# sql_powerbi_project_bikeshare
In this project, I used two main data analysis skills which are SQL and Power BI

I used data on Bike share for 2021 and 2022 with the cost and COGS table.

First, I used **Microsoft SQL Server** to load the data to a server and then used **VSCode** to run the queries.
I joined the three tables and ran my queries based on these questions -

1. What are the revenues total?
2. What is the revenue for each year?
3. What is the percentage of profit compared to each year?
4. What is the average revenue amount?
5. How did the price change affect the sales? Does it affect the demands?

After I got the answers I used **Power BI** to make an interactive dashboard with filters for each year.

I did this project on YouTube - https://youtu.be/jdGJWloo-OU?si=8dTEFegQq1p6MS1p

This project helped me to sharpen my SQL and Power BI skills.
